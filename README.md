# Debezium Workshop

Welcome to the **Debezium Workshop** repository! This collection contains practical examples and projects to help you implement Change Data Capture (CDC) using Debezium. These examples will guide you through integrating Debezium with various technologies for seamless CDC functionality.

## Repository Overview

### Projects Included:

1. **debezium-and-kafka**
    - Example project demonstrating how to integrate Debezium with Apache Kafka to capture and stream database changes in real-time.

2. **debezium-postgres-spring**
